I'd like to base my example on AWS.

I'd like to propose sending data or batches to s3 directly from front-end. Then I'd like to use SQS that notifies SNS which notifies AWS Lambda.
We could skip SQS, but using it will ensure, that no messages are lost. We could then send notification to Lambda that divides batches for smaller bites of data.
If batches are small enough we could skip that initial Lambda and send notification to Lambdas, that process data and put it into database.

Factors we need to take into consideration:
User experience, time needed to load file and how long user needs to stay on site after uploading file.
Will Lambda process batches in 45-60 minutes, before it terminates itself.
Lambda's cooldowns.
Idempotent operations on database.
It might by exaggeration, but S3 file size limit, in case we will provide files bigger than 5 terabytes :)
